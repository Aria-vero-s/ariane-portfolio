## Features

- **Bilingual Support** (EN / FR)  
- **Dynamic Page Transitions** with SVG circle reveals  
- **Lucide Icon Integration**  
- **Interactive Portfolio Showcase**  
- **Animated SVG Circuit Board Pattern**  
- **Skill Progress Bars**  
- **Fully Responsive Design**

## Style & Design

The design is modern, with focus on usability and minimalism:

- **Color Palette**  
  - Primary blue: `#091bd9`  
  - Light neutrals: `#f5f1f0` (background) & borders with subtle transparency around blue  
- **Typography**  
  - System font stack (`-apple-system`, `Segoe UI`, `Roboto`, ...) for optimal legibility and performance  
  - Hierarchy: large hero titles (4–9 rem), clear section headings (2.25 rem), body fonts scaled for readability
- **Interactions & Transitions**  
  - Smooth transitions: hover states on nav, buttons, cards  
  - SVG circuit animation uses CSS keyframes to draw and fade lines, pads, and vias for dynamic visual interest  
  - Clip-path circle reveals on navigation add a tactile, immersive feel
- **Layout & Responsiveness**  
  - Central fixed navigation that adapts: icon-only on mobile, icon + text on wider screens  
  - Responsive grid systems:
    - Portfolio: 1‑column (mobile), 2‑plus‑1 layout (tablet), 3+2 layout (desktop)
    - Service and contact sections with adaptive grid or column arrangements
- **Components & UI Patterns**  
  - Buttons: `.btn-primary` (solid) and `.btn-outline` (bordered), programmable size classes  
  - Cards and containers with soft rounded corners, consistent border styling  
  - A unified card design for skills, projects, services, and contact form enhances cohesion

## Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
